However, pretreatment or previous processing is necessary to prepare raw data for analysis before implementing data analytic procedures. This is carried out in multiple crucial phases:
Data purification: To guarantee that the analysis is conducted soundly, remove any duplicate and incomplete data entries.  
Before bringing on data analytic techniques, however, raw data must first undergo preprocessing or prior processing to prepare it for analysis. This is done in several key stages:
\begin{itemize}
\item Data cleaning: Delete any duplicate data entries along with incomplete data entries to ensure that the analysis is carried out with soundness.
\item Normalization: Scale down the basis sensor data to normalization to create scaling consistency all across the system.
\end{itemize}
The above preprocessing steps ensure the credentials of the raw data and could be ready for operation; thus, they pave the path toward efficient 5G IoT solutions.

\section{Working}
The way by which 5G achieves integration into the IoT system involves a series of key steps that provide instantaneous and efficient data communication, along with dynamic decision-making.

Every 5G-enabled Internet of Things system is built on the data input from linked devices that continually record, such as environmental monitors, traffic sensors, or medical equipment. The 5G network fills this gap by offering a fast and low-latency channel for data transmission. For instance, every second, traffic sensors in a smart city provide status updates on traffic, accidents, and vehicle flow. 5G's lightning-fast data transfer and nearly zero latency allow such data to reach the traffic management center in real-time. It gives officials the authority to promptly modify the system, such as rerouting misdirected traffic to relieve congestion or altering the timings of traffic lights. This 5G functionality is absolutely essential for a prompt and efficient response.  It empowers officials to make timely adjustments in the system, like changing the traffic light timings or rerouting redirected traffic to ease congestion. It is this feature of 5G that is extremely critical for an immediate and effective response in time-sensitive situations!


\subsection{Real-Time Decision-Making}\label{SCM}
\begin{itemize}
\item This is the step in which the data has been collected and the powerful processing that aids real-time decision support has been established
\item  Immediate changing of traffic signals based on ongoing live data to adjust for impaired traffic flow in the application of smart cities; for healthcare, it means remote patients monitoring and notifying the doctors of any critical change in a patient's condition on an immediate basis.
\item This rapid decision-making is hence made possible by low-latency and high-reliability features of the 5G network, which guarantee that vital information reaches relevant people or systems in the shortest possible time.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Output and Information Visualization}
\textbf{The last step in the 5G IoT workflow is ultimately the dissemination of the results of the real-time decisions made. Visualization tools such as dashboards and real-time notifications are utilized for the insights generated and offer visualization of conclusions that analyzed!}

Moreover, with 5G enabling smarter cities and connected devices, there is a burgeoning market for IoT (Internet of Things) solutions. Companies can develop IoT platforms and services, such as connected home devices, wearables, and health monitoring systems, all of which have the potential for high revenue generation as 5G connectivity becomes more widespread.

\item 3. Building a 5G Infrastructure Business
Another way people can tap into the financial upside of 5G is by investing in the infrastructure required to support it. This involves building the small cell towers, fiber optic networks, and other physical infrastructure needed for 5G connectivity. As the demand for 5G coverage increases, infrastructure providers stand to benefit substantially from both public and private sector contracts.

Businesses that offer services like tower leasing, network maintenance, or fiber installation can find themselves at the center of the 5G expansion, and the financial rewards from long-term contracts and infrastructure investments are potentially significant.

\item 4. Becoming a 5G-Related Consultant or Expert
With the rapid adoption of 5G, there is a significant demand for professionals with expertise in areas like network management, cybersecurity, and 5G implementation. Individuals with a technical background or business acumen can position themselves as consultants or experts to help businesses transition to 5G. This may involve advising on the integration of 5G into existing networks, optimizing business operations for 5G technologies, or guiding the development of new 5G-based business models.

Given the complexity of 5G technology, businesses are willing to pay a premium for those who can navigate the challenges associated with its implementation. For those with the right skill set, a lucrative consulting career can be a viable path to wealth.

\item 5. Real Estate and Smart Cities
5G technology plays a major role in the development of smart cities, where everything from traffic management to public services is connected and optimized through advanced technologies. This opens up opportunities in real estate development. Investors can profit by focusing on properties that are in or near areas that are being transformed into smart cities. As cities become more connected, the demand for modern, tech-friendly buildings will increase, offering significant opportunities for real estate developers.

Additionally, creating real estate ventures that integrate 5G into smart home systems or automated management systems can make properties more attractive, increasing both their value and potential rental income.
